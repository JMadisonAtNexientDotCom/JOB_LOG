This repo only contains summarys of what I have been up to.
A lot of my projects that I set up to learn... They end up ridiculously bloated.
One simple "hello world" database example project I had
got to 1 GIGABYTE.

If this wasn't bloated enterprise software, I might be able to keep my
code with my reports in the same repo. But I can't risk that seeing
as what happens sometimes.

Dates:
The files are dated by the first date that appears in that log file.
Decided to NOT use end-dates, because that could create problems in GIT
if you date something for a whole week and then decide the log file needs
to be split up.
